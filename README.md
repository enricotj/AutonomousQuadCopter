# AutonomousQuadCopter
Repo for RHIT senior project. Members: Tai Enrico, Josh Maurer, Sam Browder, Austin May, Chris Lambert

This project, despite the name, no longer involves quadcopters.  This project aims to create a motion tracking gimbal to be used to record solo action sports without the need for a camera man.  This is the specific use case that we are focusing on.  However, this gimbal system should be able to generally track isolated motion.
